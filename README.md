# metamask_button_connect

Here is an example of code for implementing a "Connect with MetaMask" button using the MetaMask provider API

This code defines a React component called MyComponent that has a button that, when clicked, connects the user to MetaMask and displays their account address. When the user is not connected, the button is shown, and when the user is connected, their account address is displayed.

Note that this is just an example and may not be production-ready. It is recommended to use well-tested libraries for interacting with MetaMask, such as the web3.js library.
